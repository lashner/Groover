# Groover

## What is Groover?

Jam is a social platform for musicians to find other musicians nearby. You can search for specific instruments or genres to find a musician that matches your needs! 

## Getting Started

Groover requires MeteorJS to work, so go to https://www.meteor.com and download the latest version.

Go to `Groover/app` and run `meteor`

After it is live you can play around with it, the Facebook integration will most likely not work so go to https://developers.facebook.com and register for a key. Replace the keys in `Groover/app/server/social-config.js` with yours. Groover only uses Facebook authentication.
